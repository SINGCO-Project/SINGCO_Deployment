Software User Interface for GWA Computation (SINGCO) is a web application
developed mainly to compute the General Weighted Average of a University of the Philippinesâ€™
student or alumna. It is prepared for the Student Records Evaluator (SRE), to ease the process
of computing GWA and certificate generation. The web application offers an automated and a
manual option for the SRE to where GWA can be calculated. Formerly, the SREs were using
Microsoft Excel as the platform for the GWA computation, which is tedious. As a response to
the problems encountered by the SREs in using the MS Excel, SINGCO was developed.
